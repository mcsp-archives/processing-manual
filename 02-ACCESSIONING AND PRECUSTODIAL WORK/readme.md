## Overview

Precustodial work is all work that occurs before a collection is formally transferred to the Moravian Archives. It includes the packing, shipping, and receiving of material, as well as managing the paperwork required to formally transfer a collection or item. Staff should be prepared to work with donors and organizational representatives to provide guidance on any precustodial actions taken by the Archives.

## 2.1 Consultations with donors and transferring entity representatives

Prior to a collection or addition being transferred by the Archives, the Director must meet with donors and transferers to provide guidance and assistance on matters such as:

* Packing and shipping
* Transfer of born digital material
* Appraisal
* Arrangement and description
* Conservation

The Director may elect to draft an Operational Impact Statement to assess the overall space and supply needs of a collection, as well as the cost of transfer, accessioning, processing, and storing a collection.

## 2.2 Collections receiving

Collections receiving is the physical transfer of collection material from a donor or transferer to the Moravian Archives. The primary point of contact for collections receiving is the Director.

### 2.2.1 Receipt of new or potential acquisitions

All new or potential acquisitions material should be received by a member of the Archives staff either at the Archie K. Davis Center or at the site where the material is being stored. Acquisitions should be moved to secure storage immediately.

#### New acquisition storage

Acquisitions that measure 5 linear feet or fewer will be stored in the new acquisition storage cabinet on the Lower Level, given space. Larger acquisitions will be moved to additional holding spaces in the Vault. Upon receipt, all new acquisitions should be labeled with the creator, collection title, date of receipt, and temporary box number. This information can be written clearly in marker on each container or labels can be created using this template. If the collection arrives with temporary box numbers, do not renumber them, as they may correspond to an inventory created during packing.

Upon receipt of material, the Archives staff member will:

* For manuscript and archives material: Create a stub accession record in ArchivesSpace, including an accompanying custody transfer event record. If the acquisition has an accompanying signed deed of sal or gift or deed addendum at the time of receipt, the staff member will also add an agreement signed event record.
* Log in Airtable MCSP Acquisitions base or update status of existing record in the base.
* Place the items and any accompanying documentation in the new acquisition storage cabinet on the Lower Level for review by the Director. If receipt is completed by the Director, this step can be skipped.
* Alert the Director that material is ready to be reviewed and provide location if other than new acquisition storage cabinet. The Director will make the final decision on whether to move forward with the acquisition.

If the Director decides to not move forward with an acquisition, it is the Director’s responsibility to notify the donor. The Archives Operations Coordinator can help coordinate return of the material once the donor has been notified by the Director.

### 2.2.2 Paperwork

No collection material may be cataloged or accessioned until the appropriate paperwork has been received. All original paperwork should be transferred to the Director.

#### Managing paperwork in OneDrive/SharePoint

Archives staff stores and manages all acquisitions-related paperwork on OneDrive. OneDrive allows staff to access shared folders and communicate with one another inside the application, creating and maintaining a record of communications for each acquisition.

There are two OneDrive folders that we use to manage this process. These can be found in the MCSP Archives document library under Collection Development and include the Gifts-in-Kind folder and the Transfers folder. As new collections move through the acquisitions process, the Director will update the files and move or update the paperwork as needed. As paperwork moves through the process, the Director will use the share function in OneDrive to update Archives staff about the status of the acquisition or to alert someone when an action is required.

#### Paperwork required for Gifts-in-Kind

The following paperwork is required to process and accession gifts:

* Deed of Gift (long) – required for new manuscript or book collections or additions to existing manuscript or book collections by a new donor

**OR**

* Deed of Gift (short) – required for additions to manuscript material to existing artificial collections or small additions of book to existing book collections

**OR**

* Deed Addendum – required for additions to existing collection by the same donor who signed the original deed

_All gifts must be accompanied by a Deed of Gift or Deed Addendum in order to be added to the collection._

#### Managing Gifts-in-Kind paperwork in OneDrive/SharePoint

The Archives manages Gifts-in-Kind paperwork on OneDrive/SharePoint through the Gifts-in-Kind folder. The Director is responsible for uploading paperwork to the folder and communicating with appropriate parties for next steps. The gifts process includes the following steps:

1.	Archives staff uploads any preliminary paperwork for acquisitions received. This could include appraisal reports or notes detailing conversations and negotiations with donors.
  a.	If multiple file formats are uploaded and cannot be combined (e.g., a Microsoft Word document and a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet), a new folder should be created using the following name convention: “Donor Name_Calendar Year Received,” such as “John Doe_2016.”
  b.	If a single file is uploaded, it should be titled using the same naming convention.
2.	The Archives staff member in communication with the donor drafts the appropriate deed and facilitates signatures by both the donor and the Director. All deeds must be signed by the Director.
3.	Once the deed is completed, it should be transferred to the Director to file and upload to OneDrive.
4.	Once uploaded, the Director will notify the Archives Operations Coordinator to create an acknowledgment letter, which will also be signed by the Director and a copy uploaded to OneDrive to become part of the collection file.
5.	When the Archives Operations Coordinator sends the acknowledgement letter, a copy of the counter-signed deed should also be included.

At the end of the calendar year, the Director moves all completed paperwork in the Gifts-in-Kind folder to the Past Gifts folder into a new subfolder for that calendar year.

The Archives does not accept unsolicited gifts and the Archives Operations Coordinator should return all such items to the sender with a letter explaining this policy with contact information to discuss the donation with staff.

#### Managing Transfers paperwork in OneDrive/SharePoint

_All transfers must be accompanied by a Records Transfer Form in order to be added to the collection._

The Archives manages transfer paperwork on OneDrive/SharePoint through the Transfers folder. The Director is responsible for uploading paperwork to the folder and communicating with appropriate parties for next steps. The transfer process includes the following steps:

1.	Archives staff uploads any preliminary paperwork for acquisitions received. This could include notes detailing conversations and negotiations with transferring entities.
a.	If multiple file formats are uploaded and cannot be combined (e.g., a Microsoft Word document and a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet), a new folder should be created using the following name convention: “Transferring Entity_Calendar Year Received,” such as “Commission on Congregational Development_2016.”
b.	If a single file is uploaded, it should be titled using the same naming convention.
2.	The Archives staff member in communication with the representative of the transferring entity drafts the Records Transfer Form and facilitates signatures by both the representative and the Director. All Records Transfer forms must be signed by the Director.
3.	Once the transfer form is completed, it should be given to the Director to file and upload to OneDrive.
4.	Once uploaded, the Director will notify the Archives Operations Coordinator to send a copy of the countersigned form to the representative of the transferring entity.

At the end of the calendar year, the Director moves all completed paperwork in the Transfers folder to the Past Transfers folder into a new subfolder for that calendar year.

### 2.2.3 Financial appraisal

Collections may be appraised under two circumstances:

1.	A donor would like to take a tax write-off greater than $5,000 on a gift-in-kind.
2.	Archives staff need a professional evaluation to determine a fair purchase price on either a prospective acquisition or on deaccessioned material being considered for a sale.

It is the donor’s responsibility to arrange and pay for appraisals for gifts-in-kind for tax purposes. 

For donor-motivated financial appraisals and financial appraisals of prospective acquisitions, the appraisal should be completed prior to physical custody transfer of the collection material. Appraisal reports conducted on behalf of the Archives should be retained in collection files.

When Archives staff need a professional evaluation, they may coordinate and facilitate that financial appraisal but cannot provide or estimate a value for any special collections material per the ACRL Code of Ethics for Special Collections Librarians, nor can we provide any tax advice to donors.

## 2.3 Accessioning

Accessioning is the basis of all archival stewardship. It is a suite of activities through which we appraise, transfer, stabilize, and document archival acquisitions. Accessioning provides pathways to access, informs future decisions, and promotes sustained resource commitment for the care of archival materials.<a href="#anchor1"><sup>1</sup></a> 

The Archives aims to make all new acquisitions available to researchers immediately following accessioning. Therefore, accessioning new material requires sufficient description to make the collection discoverable and usable. Material must be described at minimum at the collection level with a box-level inventory for the container list, but other descriptive information may be limited.

Determine the appropriate level of processing at the time of accessioning and then move forward with creating the descriptive documents.


### 2.3.1 Managing accessioning workflow

*Note: This workflow will be fully implemented in 2025. Collection material received prior to 2025 will be accessioned in ArchivesSpace but may not follow the current process.*

When material has been documented and is ready to be accessioned, the Director will share this with other staff responsible for processing. During the monthly staff meeting, the Director will provide updates on pending and new collections. The electronic version of the paperwork will be linked to from the accession record in ArchivesSpace in the External Documents sub-record.

The system of record for accession information is ArchivesSpace. The Director will create a record in this database upon receipt. One accession record should be created per acquisition, meaning there should be one record for each deed/deed addendum or transfer form.

#### When manuscript and archives material is received, the Director will:

 * Create a basic accession record in ArchivesSpace
 * Assign the accession number, as well as complete any field for which they have information, according to the guidelines in the Archives Accession Record Field Usage Guidelines.
 * Document physical receipt of the material in an event record attached to the accession record.
   * Type is equal to "custody transfer"
   * The role of the person linked as an agent is "recipient"
   * Date is the date the event record is created
* Document completion of paperwork in an event record attached to the accession record
   * Type is equal to "agreement signed"
   * The role of the donor or represntative of the transferring entity who signed the paperwork linked as an agent is "authorizer"
   * Date is the date of the signing, found on the paperwork
* If portions of the same accession are being added to multiple collections, in Disposition field of the Basic Information sub-record, describe the disposition of each portion; provide a brief description of the material and the title of the collection to which it is being added.
* Add or update the status of the acquisition in the MCSP Acquisitions Airtable base
* Add the location of the material to the Pending tab in the shelf list

#### At the time of accessioning, staff will:

*	Update and complete any fields in the accession record that the Director could not complete during receipt, according to the Archives Accession Record Field Usage Guidelines.
*	Create an event record attached to the accession record to document that the collection has been accessioned.
   * Type is equal to “accession”
 	 * The role of the staff member linked as an agent is “accessioner”
   * Date is the date the event record is created
*	If creating a new collection, assign a new manuscript number by taking the next number in sequence in the shelf list.
*	Link to an existing resource record for additions to collections or spawn a new resource record for new collections and complete the form according to the Archives Resource Record Field Usage Guidelines for stub resource records.
*	Print any needed documentation from OneDrive using the external documents link in the accession record and combine with any physical documentation in hand to add to or create the physical collection file. Write the accession number on the deed or transfer form.
*	Process the material at whichever level is deemed appropriate and create description according to the policies and procedures outlined in the Moravian Archives Processing Manual.
*	Update the status of the acquisition in the MCSP Acquisitions Airtable base.

The below instructions explain how to make accession records from start to finish. However, please note that most staff will not be creating any records from scratch. Navigate to the part of the instructions applicable to your piece of the workflow.

### 2.3.2 Creation of the accession record

Browse accessions and sort by identifier to see the most recent accession number, so that you may assign the next number in sequence.

To create the accession record, click on Create and select Accession.

Fields in ArchivesSpace marked with a red asterisk are required by ArchivesSpace. The Moravian Archives requires additional information for a record to be considered complete.

#### Populating the accession record

#### Basic information sub-record - Required

| Field                                     | Description                                                            |
| :---------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title - Required      | Assign a title for the accession. For new collections, titles should include both a name segment and the nature of the material being described. The title should be formed according to the rules outlined in the Description section of this manual. For additions, the title should include the collection title and the word “additions.” If additions are a single item or record type, the title can include that information (e.g., J. Kenneth Pfohl audiovisual additions).|
| Identifier - Required | All collection material acquired by the MCSP Archives is assigned a unique accession number, consisting of the year, the month, and the next accession number in sequence for the month (e.g., 2017-06-34).|
| Accession Date - Required | This field will auto-populate with the current date. This date should always match the day the accession record was originally created and the accession number assigned. The date of the formal accessioning process is recorded in an event record. |
| Publish | MCSP Archives does not publish accession records. This box should not be checked. |
| Content Description - Required | Include a brief description of the scope and contents of the collection. |
| Condition Description - Required if applicable | Use this field to describe preservation issues in the collection (e.g., mold, water damage, insect presence, etc.) or current organization of the collection.|
|Disposition - Required if applicable | Use this field to describe portions of the same accession with different disposition. List the items and correspondence collections in this field. |
| Inventory - Required if applicable | Use this field to transcribe any existing inventories, such as those provided by the donor or created during packing. Use this field only if the inventory is not in a document that can be linked in the External Documents sub-record. |
|Provenance - Required if applicable | Use this field to describe the provenance and custodial history of an accession. Required if there is additional provenance relevant to a specific accession that is different from the provenance of the rest of the collection. Required when the source of the material is different from the creator of the material. |
| Retention Rule - Required if applicable | Use this field to record any records management retention rules that apply to the accession. Most likely to be used for church and provincial agency records. |
| General Note - Optional | Use this field to provide any other information relevant to the accession that isn’t accounted for elsewhere in the record. |
| Acquisition Type - Required | Select the appropriate acquisition type from the dropdown menu. Select “gift” if the material is from an individual on behalf of themselves or another individual. Select “transfer” if the material is from an entity in the Moravian Church in America, Southern Province, or an individual representing such an entity. |
| Resource Type - Required | Select the appropriate resource type from the dropdown menu. Type should broadly conform to the rules established in DACS Chapter 2.3.18. Resource type may be broader than Title Statement, though they are related. |
| Language of Description | Auto populates to “English” and should remain as such. For language of material see the Languages sub-record. |
| Script of Description | Auto populates to “Latin” and should remain as such. |
| Restrictions apply? - Required when applicable | Check box if either use or access restrictions are present in the accession. |
| Access Restrictions? - Required when applicable | If any portion of the accession is restricted from access, check this box. |
| Access Restrictions Note - Required when applicable | Describe the access restriction here. If this field is in use, it must include a termination date. |
| Use Restrictions? - Required when applicable | If any portion of the accession is restricted from certain kinds of use, check this box. |
| Use Restrictions Note - Required when applicable | Describe the use restriction here. |

#### Languages sub-record - preferred when applicable

Because a significant portion of records at the MCSP Archives is written in a language other than English, primarily German, the Archives prefers for the Languages sub-record to be completed if it is obvious that the accession contains material in a language other than English. Click the “Add language” button to add languages of the material in addition to or instead of English. Add a “Language Note” to describe approximately what portion of the accession is written in each language added.

#### Dates sub-record - Required

All accession records require at least one dates sub-record. Add separate sub-records for each type of date being described (e.g., inclusive and bulk dates). More than one dates sub-record should be rare in accession records. To add a date sub-record, click the “Add Date” button in the right corner of the sub-record.

| Field                                     | Description                                                            |
| :---------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Label - Required | Defaults to "Creation" |
| Expression - Do Not Use | Expression is only used to describe dates when normalized dates are not present or if the expressed dates differ from the normalized dates. In accession records, the normalized date is preferred. |
| Type - Required | Select from the dropdown menu as appropriate. Use bulk dates for the range in which the bulk of the material in the accession was created. Use inclusive dates for the date range in which the entirety of the accession was created. Use a single day for the date of a single item or single year in which all material in the accession was created. |
| Begin and End ("Normalization") - Required | Enter the beginning and ending dates of the accession. Years are sufficient for most accessions. |
| Certainty - Required if applicable | If you are uncertain about the accuracy of the dates, select “approximate” from the dropdown menu. Otherwise, leave blank. |
| Era - Required | Defaults to "ce." |
| Calendar - Required | Defaults to "Gregorian" |

#### Extents sub-record - Required

All accession records require an extents sub-record. To add an extent record, click the "Add Extent" button in the right corner of the sub-record.

| Field                                     | Description                                                            |
| :---------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Portion - Required | Select “part” or “whole” from the dropdown menu as appropriate. Choose “whole” when the accession is the entirety of the acquisition. Choose “part” when the accession includes multiple formats (e.g., paper and born digital), and you will create multiple extent sub-records. |
| Number - Required | Enter the number of items you’re measuring. |
| Type - Required | Select from the dropdown menu as appropriate. For accessions, this will most likely be linear feet, items, or item. |
| Container Summary - Required | Use this field to describe the type of containers in which the accession is stored. This is especially helpful if the material is oversized or stored in unusual containers. |
| Physical Details - Optional | Use this field for any additional pertinent details describing the physical state of the collection. |
| Dimensions - Optional | Use this field to note the physical dimensions of the accession. Use of this field will be rare for accessions. |

#### Agent links sub-record - Required

An agent is a person, corporate body, family, or software responsible in some way for the creation or management of a described resource or the subject of that resource. Add an agent record for both the source and the creator of the accession, even if they are the same. Agent records for curators and archivists responsible for the accession will be added to event records.

See Creating an Agent Record in ArchivesSpace.

#### Related resources sub-record - Required

All accession records must be linked to a resource record. When accessioning a new collection, resource records will be spawned from the accession record and automatically linked. See Creating a Resource Record in ArchivesSpace for spawning instructions.

When accessioning additions to a collection, add a related resources sub-record. Click “Add Related Resource” in the right corner of the sub-record.

Type the title or portion of the title into the search box and select the correct collection from the menu.

#### Component links sub-record - Do Not Use

Skip this sub-record. We will only add components to resource records.

#### Related accessions sub-record - Preferred When Applicable

This subrecord links related accessions. It should be used only when material that is acquired together is accessioned into different collections and not linked to the same resource record. For example, use this record when multiple collections are created out of one acquisition from a single donor or when a single donor sends additions to multiple collections. Do not link accessions for artificial collections.

To link a related accession, click the “Add Related Accession” button in the right corner.

From the “Relationship Type” dropdown menu, select “Part of” to indicate that material has been acquired as part of a larger whole.

*	From the “This accession” dropdown menu, choose “Forms part of” or “Has part”
*	Type the title into the “Accession” search box and select the correct accession record
*	“Relator stype defaults to “Part”

The easiest way to link accessions is to create the record for the first accession and then link to that record from this sub-record on any subsequent accessions. Choose “forms part of” when completing the subsequent accessions. The links will also appear on the original record with “has part” appearing under “this accession.”

You should never have to select “sibling” as a relationship type. The sibling relationship is for linking accession records of accruals to the same collection. The Archives will be tracking those relationships in the resource record and not the accession record. If you identify a possible exception, discuss with the Director, and we will decide as a group if sibling is the correct relationship type. If it is, then complete the sub-record as follows:

*	“This accession” will pre-populate with “Is sibling of”
*	Type the title into the “Accession” search box and select the correct accession record
*	Relator type defaults to “Bound with relstionship”

#### Subjects sub-record - Do Not Use

Skip this sub-record. We will only add subject terms to resource records.

#### External documents sub-record - Required

Use this field to relevant external documentation, such as inventories, deeds, appraisal reports, and other acquisition paperwork. Link to the relevant acquisition paperwork on OneDrive/SharePoint. To create an external documents sub-record, click “Add External Document” in the right corner of the sub-record.

| Field                                     | Description                                                            |
| :---------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title - Required | Copy the title of the document from OneDrive/SharePoint |
| Location - Required | In OneDrive, click the three dots next to a file title in a folder listing. Click “Copy link.” This will grab a link only viewable by people with access to the MCSP Archives document library. Paste that link to this field in ArchivesSpace. |
| Publish - Required | Should default to de-select but check to be sure. |

#### Rights statements sub-record - Do Not Use

Skip this sub-record. We will only add rights statements to resource records.

#### Metadata rights declaration sub-record - Do Not Use

Skip this sub-record. We will only add metadata rights declarations to resource records.

#### Instances sub-record - Do Not Use

Skip this sub-record. We will only add instances to resource records.

#### Deaccessions sub-record - Required When Applicable

Add a deaccessions sub-record to record deaccessions contemporaneous to the accession. To create a deaccessions sub-record, click “Add Deaccession” in the upper right corner.

| Field                                     | Description                                                            |
| :---------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Portion - Required | Select part or whole from the dropdown menu as appropriate. |
| Description - Required | Free text field. Describe the material being deaccessioned. |
| Reason - Required | Free text field. Record the reason for the deaccession. |
| Disposition - Required | Free text field. Record the disposition of the material (e.g., shredded, returned, transferred, etc.) |
| Notification Given? - Required if applicable | Check the box if applicable |
| Deaccession Date - Required | Label should be “Deaccession.” Complete the rest of the Deaccession Date sub-record according to the rules established for the Dates sub-record. |
| Extent - Required | Record the extent of the deaccessioned material according to the rules established for the Extent sub-record. |

#### Collection management sub-record - Optional

Use this field to record internal information about processing the material. Use of this sub-record will be rare. It is likely most useful during accessioning when describing plans for processed collections with unprocessed additions.

#### Classifications sub-record - Do Not Use

Skip this sub-record. It is not applicable to MCSP Archives special collections material.

#### User defined fields sub-record - Do Not Use

Skip this sub-record. At the time of writing, MCSP Archives is not using any user defined fields.

#### Finalizing the record

When you have finished filling out the accession record, press the Save button. At this point, you may spawn a resource record for new collections, as well as add event records to the accession record as needed. Record the accession number on the paperwork and file in the physical collection file.

### 2.3.5 Creating the collection file

The permanent collection files document the history of a collection, including solicitation, acquisition, processing, and later communications with the donor or transferring entity. They will contain paperwork, such as deeds of gift and records transfer forms, as well as supporting documentation, such as donor correspondence, paper inventories, and acknowledgment letters.

When we receive a new collection, the staff member accessioning the material is responsible for communicating with the Director, who will create the collection file. The collection file’s label should include the collection title and collection number. The files are stored numerically by collection number.

If you pull a collection file from the cabinet for longer than a business day, you must complete an “out” card with the collection title, your name, and the date. When you return the file, remove the out card and add the date you returned it. One might pull a file while accessioning an addition, processing a collection, or to assist a researcher. Much of the information contained in the collection file is sensitive, and the files are considered confidential. Biographical information, restrictions, rights information, summary collection histories, and inventories may be shared with researchers if appropriate.

### 2.3.6 Accessioning checklist

## 2.4 Stacks management

The Director is responsible for maintaining the physical spaces where collection material is housed, primarily in the Vault but also in the Research Library on Level 1 of the Archie K. Davis Center. The Director will periodically conduct inventories of these spaces and maintain documentation related to collection storage space.

### 2.4.1 Stack locations

Prior to 2024, manuscript and archives collections were accessed and stored using the following schema:

*	Letter files
*	Pre-20th century records (includes church records, provincial agency records, some personal collections, and artificial collections)
*	Memoirs
*	Church registers
*	20th century agency records
*	20th century church records
*	21st century church records
*	21st century agency records
*	Periodicals
*	Personal collections

While the intellectual arrangement for these collections has changed to be provenance-based (i.e., Pre-20th century, 20th century, and 21st century records for Bethabara Moravian Church are all part of one collection), the physical arrangement has remained largely intact. For the oldest provincial agencies and churches in the Province, you would likely need to retrieve boxes from three different physical locations to pull the entire collection. ArchivesSpace is the system of record for stacks locations for containers. Please refer to location information in that system when searching for a particular box.

We have six primary stacks locations:

*	Research Library on Level 1 of the Archive K. Davis Center
     	* Ranges are referred to as 1RL, 2RL, etc.
 	    * This collection contains material owned and administered by both the Moravian Music Foundation and the MCSP Archives. Items are interfiled and shelved according to the Library of Congress classification system. Items with the code “mmf” after the call number belong to the Moravian Music Foundation and items with the code “mas” after the call number belong to the MCSP Archives.
*	Vault Manuscript and Archives Stacks
      *	Ranges 1-6 contain material owned and administered by the Moravian Music Foundation
      * Ranges 7-24 contain material owned and administered by the MCSP Archives. Most of these ranges contain fully processed collections.
      * A significant portion of our periodicals are held on ranges 17-A through 18-A instead of with the rare book collection.
* Vault Rare Books Stacks
      *Ranges 1L-2L contain material owned and administered by the Moravian Music Foundation
      *Ranges 3L-10L contain material owned and administered by the MCSP Archives
      *Only the items on 3L and 10L have been cataloged. They are shelved according to the Dewey Decimal classification system.
      *Range 8L contains periodicals not housed on the manuscript and archives side of the Vault
      *Range 9L contains the Daily Text and the Bible collection
      *Range 10L contains hymnals and liturgical texts
*	Vault Temporary/Processing Stacks
      * Ranges 16 and 20-24 of the manuscript and archives side of the Vault are currently housing unprocessed manuscript and archives collection material
      * Range 6L and 7L of the rare book side of the Vault are currently housing unprocessed manuscript and archives collection material
*	Vault AV and photographic material room
      * On the manuscript and archives side of the Vault, near range 12, there is a door to a room inside the Vault. This room houses photographic material, artwork, and audiovisual material held by both the Moravian Music Foundation and the MCSP Archives
*	Vault Map files
      * There are five map files at the entrance of the Vault. One contains material held by the Moravian Music Foundation. MCSP Archives owns and administers the contents of the other four, identified as Map File A, B, C, and D.
      * Not everything in the map file is a map – often this is where oversized material of all file types can be found.
      * Maps that are not oversized can also be found in the map files
      * Maps that are too large to fit in the map files are stored on range 23 on the manuscript and archives side of the Vault

We communicate stack locations by giving a range and bay for an item:

*	Ranges are one side of an aisle. These are numbered. 1 refers to range 1 on the manuscript and archives side of the Vault. 1L refers to range 1 on the rare books side of the Vault. 1RL refers to range 1 in the Research Library.
*	Bays are sections of shelving within the range. The bays receive alphabetical designations. When you are looking at a range the A bay will be on your left and proceed through the alphabet to your right. Always read bays left to right when you face them. Start the alphabet over for each range.
*	Shelves are the individual shelves within a bay.

### 2.4.2 Shelf lists

The system of record for container locations is ArchivesSpace. However, there is also a shelf list table in the Airtable MCSP Collections base that automatically updates with locations and extents for each collection as that information is updated in the containers table of the same base. To locate the entirety of a collection at a glance, this is the fastest method. ArchivesSpace will always be more accurate.

### 2.4.3 Empty space map

ArchivesSpace also tracks empty space. However, it can sometimes be easier to visualize empty space on a map. MCSP Archives maintains a map of empty space in our stacks locations. It should be updated any time collection material is moved to, from, or around in the Vault or the Research Library. The Director will periodically verify the document to ensure that it is up-to-date.

### 2.4.4 Lost items
