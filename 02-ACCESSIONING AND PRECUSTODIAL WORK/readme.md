## Overview

Precustodial work is all work that occurs before a collection is formally transferred to the Moravian Archives. It includes the packing, shipping, and receiving of material, as well as managing the paperwork required to formally transfer a collection or item. Staff should be prepared to work with donors and organizational representatives to provide guidance on any precustodial actions taken by the Archives.

## 2.1 Consultations with donors and transferring entity representatives

Prior to a collection or addition being transferred by the Archives, the Archivist must meet with donors and transferers to provide guidance and assistance on matters such as:

* Packing and shipping
* Transfer of born digital material
* Appraisal
* Arrangement and description
* Conservation

The Archivist may elect to draft an Operational Impact Statement to assess the overall space and supply needs of a collection, as well as the cost of transfer, accessioning, processing, and storing a collection.

## 2.2 Collections receiving

Collections receiving is the physical transfer of collection material from a donor or transferer to the Moravian Archives. The primary point of contact for collections receiving is the Archivist.

### 2.2.1 Receipt of new or potential acquisitions

All new or potential acquisitions material should be received by a member of the Archives staff either at the Archie K. Davis Center or at the site where the material is being stored. Acquisitions should be moved to secure storage immediately.

#### New acquisition storage

Acquisitions that measure 5 linear feet or fewer will be stored in the new acquisition storage cabinet on the Lower Level, given space. Larger acquisitions will be moved to additional holding spaces in the Vault. Upon receipt, all new acquisitions should be labeled with the creator, collection title, date of receipt, and temporary box number. This information can be written clearly in marker on each container or labels can be created using this template. If the collection arrives with temporary box numbers, do not renumber them, as they may correspond to an inventory created during packing.

Upon receipt of material, the Archives staff member will:

* For manuscript and archives material: Create a stub accession record in ArchivesSpace, including an accompanying custody transfer event record. If the acquisition has an accompanying signed deed of sal or gift or deed addendum at the time of receipt, the staff member will also add an agreement signed event record.
* Log in Airtable MCSP Acquisitions base or update status of existing record in the base.
* Place the items and any accompanying documentation in the new acquisition storage cabinet on the Lower Level for review by the Archivist. If receipt is completed by the Archivist, this step can be skipped.
* Alert the Archivist that material is ready to be reviewed and provide location if other than new acquisition storage cabinet. The Archivist will make the final decision on whether to move forward with the acquisition.

If the Archivist decides to not move forward with an acquisition, it is the Archivist’s responsibility to notify the donor. The Archives Operations Coordinator can help coordinate return of the material once the donor has been notified by the Archivist.

### 2.2.2 Paperwork

No collection material may be cataloged or accessioned until the appropriate paperwork has been received. All original paperwork should be transferred to the Archivist.

#### Managing paperwork in OneDrive/SharePoint

Archives staff stores and manages all acquisitions-related paperwork on OneDrive. OneDrive allows staff to access shared folders and communicate with one another inside the application, creating and maintaining a record of communications for each acquisition.

There are two OneDrive folders that we use to manage this process. These can be found in the MCSP Archives document library under Collection Development and include the Gifts-in-Kind folder and the Transfers folder. As new collections move through the acquisitions process, the Archivist will update the files and move or update the paperwork as needed. As paperwork moves through the process, the Archivist will use the share function in OneDrive to update Archives staff about the status of the acquisition or to alert someone when an action is required.

#### Paperwork required for Gifts-in-Kind

The following paperwork is required to process and accession gifts:

* Deed of Gift (long) – required for new manuscript or book collections or additions to existing manuscript or book collections by a new donor

**OR**

* Deed of Gift (short) – required for additions to manuscript material to existing artificial collections or small additions of book to existing book collections

**OR**

* Deed Addendum – required for additions to existing collection by the same donor who signed the original deed

_All gifts must be accompanied by a Deed of Gift or Deed Addendum in order to be added to the collection._

#### Managing Gifts-in-Kind paperwork in OneDrive/SharePoint

The Archives manages Gifts-in-Kind paperwork on OneDrive/SharePoint through the Gifts-in-Kind folder. The Archivist is responsible for uploading paperwork to the folder and communicating with appropriate parties for next steps. The gifts process includes the following steps:

1.	Archives staff uploads any preliminary paperwork for acquisitions received. This could include appraisal reports or notes detailing conversations and negotiations with donors.
  a.	If multiple file formats are uploaded and cannot be combined (e.g., a Microsoft Word document and a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet), a new folder should be created using the following name convention: “Donor Name_Calendar Year Received,” such as “John Doe_2016.”
  b.	If a single file is uploaded, it should be titled using the same naming convention.
2.	The Archives staff member in communication with the donor drafts the appropriate deed and facilitates signatures by both the donor and the Archivist. All deeds must be signed by the Archivist.
3.	Once the deed is completed, it should be transferred to the Archivist to file and upload to OneDrive.
4.	Once uploaded, the Archivist will notify the Archives Operations Coordinator to create an acknowledgment letter, which will also be signed by the Archivist and a copy uploaded to OneDrive to become part of the collection file.
5.	When the Archives Operations Coordinator sends the acknowledgement letter, a copy of the counter-signed deed should also be included.

At the end of the calendar year, the Archivist moves all completed paperwork in the Gifts-in-Kind folder to the Past Gifts folder into a new subfolder for that calendar year.

The Archives does not accept unsolicited gifts and the Archives Operations Coordinator should return all such items to the sender with a letter explaining this policy with contact information to discuss the donation with staff.

#### Managing Transfers paperwork in OneDrive/SharePoint

_All transfers must be accompanied by a Records Transfer Form in order to be added to the collection._

The Archives manages transfer paperwork on OneDrive/SharePoint through the Transfers folder. The Archivist is responsible for uploading paperwork to the folder and communicating with appropriate parties for next steps. The transfer process includes the following steps:

1.	Archives staff uploads any preliminary paperwork for acquisitions received. This could include notes detailing conversations and negotiations with transferring entities.
a.	If multiple file formats are uploaded and cannot be combined (e.g., a Microsoft Word document and a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet), a new folder should be created using the following name convention: “Transferring Entity_Calendar Year Received,” such as “Commission on Congregational Development_2016.”
b.	If a single file is uploaded, it should be titled using the same naming convention.
2.	The Archives staff member in communication with the representative of the transferring entity drafts the Records Transfer Form and facilitates signatures by both the representative and the Archivist. All Records Transfer forms must be signed by the Archivist.
3.	Once the transfer form is completed, it should be given to the Archivist to file and upload to OneDrive.
4.	Once uploaded, the Archivist will notify the Archives Operations Coordinator to send a copy of the countersigned form to the representative of the transferring entity.

At the end of the calendar year, the Archivist moves all completed paperwork in the Transfers folder to the Past Transfers folder into a new subfolder for that calendar year.

### 2.2.3 Financial appraisal

Collections may be appraised under two circumstances:

1.	A donor would like to take a tax write-off greater than $5,000 on a gift-in-kind.
2.	Archives staff need a professional evaluation to determine a fair purchase price on either a prospective acquisition or on deaccessioned material being considered for a sale.

It is the donor’s responsibility to arrange and pay for appraisals for gifts-in-kind for tax purposes. 

For donor-motivated financial appraisals and financial appraisals of prospective acquisitions, the appraisal should be completed prior to physical custody transfer of the collection material. Appraisal reports conducted on behalf of the Archives should be retained in collection files.

When Archives staff need a professional evaluation, they may coordinate and facilitate that financial appraisal but cannot provide or estimate a value for any special collections material per the ACRL Code of Ethics for Special Collections Librarians, nor can we provide any tax advice to donors.

## 2.3 Accessioning

Accessioning is the basis of all archival stewardship. It is a suite of activities through which we appraise, transfer, stabilize, and document archival acquisitions. Accessioning provides pathways to access, informs future decisions, and promotes sustained resource commitment for the care of archival materials.<a href="#anchor1"><sup>1</sup></a> 

The Archives aims to make all new acquisitions available to researchers immediately following accessioning. Therefore, accessioning new material requires sufficient description to make the collection discoverable and usable. Material must be described at minimum at the collection level with a box-level inventory for the container list, but other descriptive information may be limited.

Determine the appropriate level of processing at the time of accessioning and then move forward with creating the descriptive documents.
